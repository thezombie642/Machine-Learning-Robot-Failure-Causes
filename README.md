Aims to deduce the correlation between:

* Failures in approach to grasp position
* Failures in transfer of a part
* Position of part after a transfer failure
* Failures in approach to ungrasp position
* Failures in motion with part

and a given matrix of force, torque values using a variety of machine learning approaches.
